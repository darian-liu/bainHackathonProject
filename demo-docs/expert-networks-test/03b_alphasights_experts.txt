Hi Team,

Here are additional payment technology experts for your due diligence:

**Michael Torres**
Position: SVP, Head of Product at Stripe
Previous Experience: Square, PayPal
Education: MBA Stanford, BS Computer Science UC Berkeley

Relevant Expertise:
- Led Stripe's core payments product strategy
- Built Square's international payment capabilities
- Deep expertise in merchant acquiring and payment processing

AlphaSights Screener Responses:
Q: How do you evaluate payment technology companies?
A: I look at three key areas: (1) unit economics on transaction volume, (2) developer experience and API quality, (3) regulatory compliance infrastructure. The best companies excel at all three.

Q: What technological moats exist in the payments space?
A: Network effects are the primary moat. Once you have significant merchant and consumer adoption, switching costs are high. Data advantages for fraud detection come second.

Q: Discuss embedded finance trends you're observing.
A: Every software company wants to be a fintech company now. We're seeing massive demand for embedded payments, lending, and card issuance. This is a tailwind for infrastructure players like Stripe.

AlphaSights Screener Responses:
Q: How do you evaluate payment technology companies?
A: Technical architecture is foundational. Can the system handle peak loads? How is latency distributed globally? What's the approach to redundancy? Then look at feature velocity.

Q: What technological moats exist in the payments space?
A: Scale and optimization capabilities. Routing transactions optimally across multiple processors to maximize authorization rates requires enormous data and sophisticated ML models.

Conflict Status: Cleared
Availability: Flexible week of March 4
