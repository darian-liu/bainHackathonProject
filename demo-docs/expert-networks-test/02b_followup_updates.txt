**Dr. Sarah Kim - Additional Screener Responses:**
Q: What are your views on AI applications in clinical settings?
A: I'm cautiously optimistic. We've deployed AI-assisted radiology tools at UCLA with measurable improvements in early detection, but physician oversight remains critical. The regulatory landscape is still evolving.

Q: How would you evaluate a health tech company's product-market fit?
A: I look at three things: clinical workflow integration (does it fit how physicians actually work?), evidence base (is there published validation?), and IT feasibility (can it actually be deployed in typical health system environments?).

Please let me know your preferred times and I'll get these scheduled.

Best,
Emma
