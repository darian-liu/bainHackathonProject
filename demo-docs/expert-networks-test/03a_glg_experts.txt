Hi Team,

Per your request, here are fintech/payments experts from our network:

**Michael Torres**
Current: SVP, Head of Product at Stripe
Previous: Director of Payments at Square (2017-2021)
Background:
- 12 years in payments technology
- Led Square's international expansion
- Expert in payment processing infrastructure and fraud detection

Screener Responses (GLG Screener):
Q: What payment rails do you have direct experience with?
A: I've worked extensively with card networks (Visa/Mastercard), ACH, wire transfers, and real-time payments. At Stripe, I led our expansion into local payment methods across 15+ countries.

Q: What's your perspective on the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market?
A: BNPL is consolidating. The unit economics are challenging for pure-play providers, which is why you see the major players being acquired or pivoting. I expect the feature to become table stakes for traditional payments companies.

Conflict Status: Cleared
Availability: Wednesday Mar 6, 2-4pm PST

**Lisa Park**
Current: VP of Engineering at PayPal
Previous: Principal Engineer at Visa
Background:
- Built PayPal's real-time fraud detection system
- 15 years in payment technology
- Expert in PCI compliance and security architecture

Screener Responses (GLG Screener):
Q: What payment rails do you have direct experience with?
A: Deep experience with card networks from my Visa days. At PayPal, I've expanded into alternative payment methods and crypto settlements.

Q: What's your perspective on the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market?
A: From an engineering perspective, BNPL integration is straightforward. The challenge is credit risk modeling - something PayPal has an advantage in given our data assets.

Conflict Status: Pending
Availability: TBD
